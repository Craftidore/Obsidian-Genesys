# Obsidian Genesys

Here is a compilation of various Obsidian tools useful for the Genesys RPG (and Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars RPG, but that has lower priority). At the moment, that's just my Genesys Dice & Star Wars Dice css snippets, but if you have something to add, please make a pull request adding it to the list. 

## Genesys Dice

The Genesys Dice snippet converts tags like `#GenesysProficiency`, `#GenesysSuccess` to dice images in Obsidian. If you want to see it in action, <a href="#ToInstall">install</a> the snippet.

This snippet does have some slight support for the Style Settings community plugin, but is functional without it.

<h3 id="ToInstall">To Install</h3>

1. Copy paste [this snippet](./snippets/GenesysDice/GenesysDice.css) into the `.obsidian/snippets/` folder of your vault.
2. Navigate to `Settings` → `Appearance` → `Reload Snippets`, then enable the snippet.
3. You may also have to add a bit of theme fixing css if you aren't using the default Obsidian theme. Create an Issue and I'll see about creating one (or, if you create your own fix, make a pull request and I'll add it to the collection).
4. Additionally, I suggest copy pasting [this note](./examples/GenesysDiceExample.md) into your vault. This will show you all the tags which work do stuff *and* let Obsidian start autocompleting your tags into Genesys Dice and Symbols. 

## Star Wars Dice

I also created a Star Wars Dice snippet that works the same as the Genesys Dice one. 

### To Install
1. Copy paste [this snippet](./snippets/StarWarsDice/StarWarsDice.css) into the `.obsidian/snippets/` folder of your vault.
